{\dime} provides good accuracy in terms of delay injection, local memory management and emulator isolation compared to existing emulators. We also show that it is capable of emulating real world applications and can be used to evaluate application performance in disaggregated memory environment. {\dime} allows fine grained partitioning of memory and flexibility to manage local memory with custom algorithms.

Since the disaggregated memory architecture is still in exploration phase, we will continue to add more features as the architecture evolves.

We plane to build a realistic emulator by involving more physical machines. A single machine will act as a remote memory blade and other servers will be able to map its memory into their own address space over RDMA.
