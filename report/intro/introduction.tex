\chapter{Introduction}

Traditional datacenters are built of collection of servers, and each server has dedicated resources, which are memory, cpu, non-volatile storage (SSD, HDD), network, etc. Per-server memory demands are increasing due to large-memory applications. Leading to more power to operate the memory. A new memory architecture is required to efficiently use the available memory. By disaggregating memory, multiple compute blades can connect to a single memory blade and dynamically share its capacity, resulting in decreased memory requirement and lower power consumption.

We have produced a linux kernel module which tracks the memory accesses by a process and emulates the delay caused by transferring remote memory data to local memory.
