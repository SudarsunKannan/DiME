\begin{Abstract}
Disaggregating various resources is the recent trend in datacenter architectures, where resources of same type are disaggregated in resource pools, e.g. compute resource, storage resource, network resource, memory resource. Disaggregation helps in efficient use of power and resources by sharing among disaggregated servers based on their usage patterns. 

We aim to emulate disaggregated memory for a process, so that application developers can use the emulator in development process for testing purpose to make application more efficient in disaggregated environment.
